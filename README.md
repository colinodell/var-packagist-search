This is the code which powered my analysis of <https://wiki.php.net/rfc/var_deprecation#low_usage>.  It is not elegant and was never intended to be seen by anyone, so please don't judge me too harshly on something I quickly cobbled together ðŸ™ƒ

Consider this licensed under the MIT License.  I don't care what you do with it.  Well... just don't use any of this in production without double-checking that things actually work.
